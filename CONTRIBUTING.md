## Tests

### Unit tests

We use the standard test suite in combination with [github.com/stretchr/testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) to do our unit testing. Mocks are generated using [mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) a mock generator using this command `make test_generate_mocks`.

To run them, please run:

```sh
make test_unit
```

### Feature tests (of end to end tests)

We use docker to run a Badaas instance in combination with one node of CockroachDB.

Run:

```sh
make test_e2e
```

The feature files can be found in the `test_e2e/features` folder.

## Logger

We use uber's [zap](https://pkg.go.dev/go.uber.org/zap) to log stuff, please take `zap.Logger` as an argument for your services constructors. [fx](https://github.com/uber-go/fx) will provide your service with an instance.

## Directory structure

This is the directory structure we use for the project:

- `configuration/` *(Go code)*: Contains all the configuration keys and holders. Please only use the interfaces, they are all mocked for easy testing.
- `controllers/` *(Go code)*: Contains all the http controllers, they handle http requests and consume services.
- `docker/` : Contains the docker, docker-compose file and configuration files for different environments.
  - `test_db/` : Contains the Dockerfile to build a development/test version of CockroachDB.
  - `test_api/` : Contains files to build a development/test version of the api.
- `test_e2e/`: Contains all the feature and steps for e2e tests.
- `logger/` *(Go code)*: Contains the logger creation logic. Please don't call it from your own services and code, use the dependency injection system.
- `persistance/` *(Go code)*:
  - `gormdatabase/` *(Go code)*: Contains the logic to create a <https://gorm.io> database. Also contains a go package named `gormzap`: it is a compatibility layer between *gorm.io/gorm* and *github.com/uber-go/zap*.
  - `models/` *(Go code)*: Contains the models. (For a structure to me considered a valid model, it has to embed `models.BaseModel` and satisfy the `models.Tabler` interface. This interface returns the name of the sql table.).
    - `dto/` *(Go code)*: Contains the Data Transfer Objects. They are used mainly to decode json payloads.
  - `pagination/` *(Go code)*: Contains the pagination logic.
  - `repository/` *(Go code)*: Contains the repository interfaces and implementations to manage queries to the database.
- `router/` *(Go code)*: Contains http router of badaas.
  - `middlewares/` *(Go code)*: Contains the various http middlewares that we use.
- `services/` *(Go code)*: Contains services.
  - `auth/protocols/`: Contains the implementations of authentication clients for different protocols.
    - `basicauth/` *(Go code)*: Handle the authentication using email/password.
  - `sessionservice/` *(Go code)*: Handle sessions and their lifecycle.
  - `userservice/` *(Go code)*: Handle users.
- `utils/` *(Go code)*: Contains utility functions that can be used all around the project.
- `validators/` *(Go code)*: Contains validators such as an email validator.

At the root of the project, you will find:

- The README.
- The changelog.
- The LICENSE file.

## Git

### Branch naming policy

`[BRANCH_TYPE]/[BRANCH_NAME]`

- `BRANCH_TYPE` is a prefix to describe the purpose of the branch.
  Accepted prefixes are:
  - `feature`, used for feature development
  - `bugfix`, used for bug fix
  - `improvement`, used for refactor
  - `library`, used for updating library
  - `prerelease`, used for preparing the branch for the release
  - `release`, used for releasing project
  - `hotfix`, used for applying a hotfix on main
  - `poc`, used for proof of concept
- `BRANCH_NAME` is managed by this regex: `[a-z0-9._-]` (`_` is used as space character).

### Default branch

The default branch is `main`. Direct commit on it is forbidden. The only way to update the application is through pull request.

Release tag are only done on the `main` branch.

### How to release

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) as guideline for the version management.

Steps to release:

- Create a new branch labeled `release/vX.Y.Z` from the latest `main`.
- Improve the version number in `changelog.md`.
- Verify the content of the `changelog.md`.
- Commit the modifications with the label `Release version X.Y.Z`.
- Create a pull request on github for this branch into `main`.
- Once the pull request validated and merged, tag the `main` branch with `vX.Y.Z`.
- After the tag is pushed, make the release on the tag in GitHub.
