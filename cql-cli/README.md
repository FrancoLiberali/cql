To build the project:

For more information about the functionality provided and how to use each command use:

### cql-cli gen conditions

gen conditions is the command you can use to generate conditions to query your objects using cql. For each cql.Model found in the input packages a file containing all possible Conditions on that object will be generated, allowing you to use cql.

Its use is recommended through `go generate`. To see an example of how to do it visit the [quickstart](https://github.com/FrancoLiberali/cql-quickstart/blob/main/conditions/cql.go).
