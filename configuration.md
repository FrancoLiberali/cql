# Configuration

To see a complete example of a working config file: head to [`badaas.example.yml`](./badaas.example.yml).

As said in the README:

> Badaas can be configured using environment variables, CLI flags or a configuration file.
> CLI flags take priority on the environment variables and the environment variables take priority on the content of the configuration file.

In this documentation file, we will mainly focus our attention on config files but we won't forget that we can use environment variables and CLI flags to change Badaas' config.

The config file can be formatted in any syntax that [`viper`](https://github.com/spf13/viper) supports but we will only use YAML syntax in our docs.

## Database

We use CockroachDB as a database. It is Postgres compatible, so the information we need to provide will not be a surprise to Postgres users.

```yml
# The settings for the database.
database:
  # The host of the database server. 
  # (mandatory)
  host: e2e-db-1

  # The port of the database server. 
  #Â (mandatory)
  port: 26257

  # The name of the database to use. 
  name: badaas_db

  # The sslmode of the connection to the database server. 
  # (mandatory)
  sslmode: disable

  # The username of the account on the database server. 
  # (mandatory)
  username: root

  # The password of the account on the database server.
  # (mandatory)
  password: postgres

  # The settings for the initialization of the database server. 
  init:
    # Number of time badaas will try to establish a connection to the database server.
    # default (10)
    retry: 10

    # Waiting time between connection, in seconds.
    # default (5)
    retryTime: 5
```

Please note that the init section `init:` is not mandatory. Badaas is suited with a simple but effective retry mechanism that will retry `database.init.retry` time to establish a connection with the database. Badaas will wait `database.init.retryTime` seconds between each retry.

## Logger

Badaas use a structured logger that can output json logs in production and user adapted logs for debug using the `logger.mode` key.

Badaas offers the possibility to change the log message of the Middleware Logger but provides a sane default. It is formatted using the Jinja syntax. The values available are `method`, `url` and `protocol`.

```yml
# The settings for the logger.
logger:
  # Either `dev` or `prod`
  # default (`prod`)
  mode: prod
  request:
    # Change the log emitted when badaas receives a request on a valid endpoint.
    template: "Receive {{method}} request on {{url}}"
```

## HTTP Server

You can change the host Badaas will bind to, the port and the timeout in seconds.

Additionally you can change the number of elements returned by default for a paginated response.

```yml
# The settings for the http server.
server:
  # The address to bind badaas to.
  # default ("0.0.0.0")
  host: "" 

  # The port badaas should use.
  # default (8000)
  port: 8000

  # The maximum timeout for the http server in seconds.
  # default (15)
  timeout: 15 

  # The settings for the pagination.
  pagination:
    page:
      # The maximum number of record per page 
      # default (100)
      max: 100
```

## Default values

The section allow to change some settings for the first run.

```yml
# The settings for the first run.
default:
  # The admin settings for the first run
  admin:
    # The admin password for the first run. Won't change is the admin user already exists.
    password: admin
```

## Session management

You can change the way the session service handle user sessions.
Session are extended if the user made a request to badaas in the "roll duration". The session duration and the refresh interval of the cache can be changed. They contains some good defaults.

Please see the diagram below to see what is the roll duration relative to the session duration.

```txt
     |   session duration                        |
     |<----------------------------------------->|
 ----|-------------------------|-----------------|----> time
     |                         |                 |
                               |<--------------->|
                                  roll duration
```

```yml
# The settings for session service
# This section contains some good defaults, don't change those value unless you need to.
session:
  # The duration of a user session, in seconds
  # Default (14400) equal to 4 hours
  duration: 14400
  # The refresh interval in seconds. Badaas refresh it's internal session cache periodically.
  # Default (30)
  pullInterval: 30
  # The duration in which the user can renew it's session by making a request.
  # Default (3600) equal to 1 hour
  rollDuration: 3600
```
