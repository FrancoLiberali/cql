# Developing

This document provides the information you need to know before developing code for a pull request.

## Environment

- Install [go](https://go.dev/doc/install) >= v1.20
- Install project dependencies: `go get`
- Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Directory structure

This is the directory structure we use for the project:

- `configuration/`: Contains all the configuration holders. Please only use the interfaces, they are all mocked for easy testing.
- `controllers/`: Contains all the http controllers, they handle http requests and consume services.
- `docker/` : Contains the docker, docker-compose and configuration files for different environments.
- `docs/`: Contains the documentation showed for readthedocs.io.
- `httperrors/`: Contains the http errors that can be responded by the http api. Should be moved to `controller/` when services stop using them.
- `logger/`: Contains the logger creation logic. Please don't call it from your own services and code, use the dependency injection system.
- `mocks/`: Contains the mocks generated with `mockery`.
- `orm/` *(Go code)*: Contains the code of the orm used by badaas.
- `persistance/`:
  - `database/`: Contains the logic to create a <https://gorm.io> database.
  - `models/`: Contains the models.
    - `dto/`: Contains the Data Transfer Objects. They are used mainly to decode json payloads.
  - `repository/`: Contains the repository interfaces and implementations to manage queries to the database.
- `router/`: Contains http router of badaas and the routes that can be added by the user.
  - `middlewares/`: Contains the various http middlewares that we use.
- `services/`: Contains services.
  - `auth/protocols/`: Contains the implementations of authentication clients for different protocols.
    - `basicauth/`: Handle the authentication using email/password.
    - `oidc/`: Handle the authentication via Open-ID Connect.
- `test_e2e/`: Contains all the feature and steps for e2e tests.
- `testintegration/`: Contains all the integration tests.
- `utils/`: Contains functions that can be util all around the project, as managing data structures, time, etc.

At the root of the project, you will find:

- The README.
- The changelog.
- The LICENSE file.

## Tests

### Dependencies

Running tests have some dependencies as: `mockery`, `gotestsum`, etc.. Install them with `make install_dependencies`.

### Linting

We use `golangci-lint` for linting our code. You can test it with `make lint`. The configuration file is in the default path (`.golangci.yml`). The file `.vscode.settings.json.template` is a template for your `.vscode/settings.json` that formats the code according to our configuration.

### Unit tests

We use the standard test suite in combination with [github.com/stretchr/testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) to do our unit testing. Mocks are generated using [mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) using the command `make test_generate_mocks`.

To run them, use:

```sh
make -k test_unit
```

### Integration tests

Integration tests have a database and the dependency injection system. Badaas-orm is tested on multiple databases. By default, the database used will be postgresql:

```sh
make test_integration
```

To run the tests on another database you can use: `make test_integration_postgresql`, `make test_integration_cockroachdb`, `make test_integration_mysql`, `make test_integration_sqlite`, `make test_integration_sqlserver`. All of them will be verified by our continuous integration system.

### Feature tests (end to end tests)

These are black box tests that test BaDaaS using its http api. We use docker to run a Badaas instance in combination with one node of CockroachDB.

Run:

```sh
make test_e2e
```

The feature files can be found in the `test_e2e/features` folder.

## Requirements

To be acceptable, contributions must:

- Have a good quality of code, based on <https://go.dev/doc/effective_go>.
- Have at least 80 percent new code coverage (although a higher percentage may be required depending on the importance of the feature). The tests that contribute to coverage are unit tests and integration tests.
- The features defined in the PR base issue must be explicitly tested by an e2e test or by integration tests in case it is not possible (for badaas-orm features for example).

## Use of Third-party code

Third-party code must include licenses.
