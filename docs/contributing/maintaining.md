## How to release

Release tag are only done on the `main` branch. We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) as guideline for the version management.

Steps to release:

- Create a new branch labeled `release/vX.Y.Z` from the latest `main`.
- Improve the version number in `cql-gen/version/version.go` and `cqllint/version/version.go`.
- Commit the modifications with the label `Release version X.Y.Z`.
- Create a pull request on github for this branch into `main`.
- Once the pull request validated and merged, tag the `main` branch using `./create_tag.sh X.Y.Z`.
